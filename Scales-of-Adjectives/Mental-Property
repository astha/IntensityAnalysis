The adjectives and nouns in this frame are all based on the idea that mental properties may be attributed to a person (Protagonist) by a (usually implicit) Judge on the basis of that person's Behavior, as broadly understood. Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in "It was stupid of me to do that".
