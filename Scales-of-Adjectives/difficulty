An Experiencer has an easy or difficult time carrying out an Activity. The ease or difficulty associated with the Activity seems to often be associated with a prominent participant. However, we consider this impression to be due to the syntax and pragmatics of the relevant sentence constructions and employ no special FE for such participants. The Degree of ease or difficulty is often specified as well as a set of Circumstances. A Parameter may be mentioned that indicates in which respect the Activity is judged to be easy or difficult.
