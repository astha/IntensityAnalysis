A Cognizer has a piece of Content in their model of the world. The Content is not necessarily present due to immediate perception, but usually, rather, due to deduction from perceivables. In some cases, the deduction of the Content is implicitly based on confidence in sources of information (believe), in some cases based on logic (think), and in other cases the source of the deduction is deprofiled (know). Note that this frame is undergoing some degree of reconsideration. Many of the targets will be moved to the Opinion frame. That frame indicates that the Cognizer considers something as true, but the Opinion (compare to Content) is not presupposed to be true; rather it is something that is considered a potential point of difference. In the uses that will remain in the Awareness frame, however, the Content is presupposed. Your boss is aware of your commitment.
