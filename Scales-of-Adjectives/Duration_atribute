An event or state (here termed an Eventuality) or time-Period is described in terms of the Degree to which its duration diverges from a standard. As is usual for gradable attributes, the standard of comparison is normally based on the expected duration for the type of Eventuality or Period. (In conjunction with the comparative construction, the standard may also be based upon an explicit value.)
