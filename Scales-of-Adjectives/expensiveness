A Payer gives up (or potentially gives up) the use of an Asset (generally money) in order to achieve an Intended_event. This event is often more specifically described as gaining possession of some Goods or receiving a Service. In the majority of cases, the Payer is described generically (INI), and the situation depicted answers the question of how much of an Asset would have to be given up to receive the Goods or bring about the Intended_event.
