This frame concerns an Evaluee being judged for its quality, i.e. how much it would probably be liked. In many cases, the Evaluee is implicitly judged good or bad relative to other instances of its type. The Evaluee's desirability is determined by one or more Parameters, which are scalar properties of the Evaluee. The evaluation may also explicitly be relativized to a set of Circumstances, a Comparison_set of entities that belong to the same class as the Evaluee, or an Affected_party. The Degree of goodness or badness may also be expressed.
