An Item is located on a Scale relative to a critical value which is determined by some Enabled_situation. Generally, when the Enabled_situation is left unexpressed the Enabled_situation is interpreted to be the desirability of the Item being located within a particular range on the Scale. With many of the adjectives of this frame, the Scale is not explicitly mentioned; in such cases, the Scale is usually the quantity, incorporated in the meaning of the targets themselves, though in the case of adequacy, etc. the Scale referred to is quality. I probably have enough.

adequacy.n, adequate.a, adequately.adv, ample.a, enough.a, enough.adv, enough.n, inadequacy.n, inadequate.a, inadequately.adv, insufficiency.n, insufficient.a, insufficiently.adv, plenty.a, plenty.adv, plenty.n, so.adv, suffice.v, sufficient.a, sufficiently.adv, too.adv
